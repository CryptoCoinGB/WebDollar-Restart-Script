# WebDollar Restart Script
These scripts are designed to help you restart your WebDollar node after each PoW (Proof of Work) round to reduce power consumption. Due to a bug in CPU-CPP, it doesn't always release all the threads used during a PoW round resulting in increased power consumpion during the PoS (Proof of Stake) round. This is unnecessary and can be solved by restarting your miner automatically with these scripts.
